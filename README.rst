Flask-Squirrel
==============

The squirrel collects your nuts and stores them into your SQL database so it is a REST API which accesses your database.
It is based on Flask, Flask-RESTful and Flask-SQLAlchemy.

Major benefits:

- The database data is formatted as a JSON which can be used by the great jQuery library datatables.
- Multilanguage
- Allows custom business logic
- Basic document upload support
- No HTML is generated - REST API only
